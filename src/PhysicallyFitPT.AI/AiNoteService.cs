SUBJECTIVE:
Patient reports {(wordCount > 20 ? "detailed symptoms" : "brief symptoms")} as documented in intake notes. 
{(patientContext != null ? $"Context: {patientContext}" : "No additional context provided.")}

OBJECTIVE:
- Input analyzed: {wordCount} words
- Assessment performed at: {timestamp:g}
- Prototype AI v0.1 used for generation

ASSESSMENT:
Based on the provided information, preliminary assessment indicates need for further evaluation.
This is a prototype output and should be reviewed by a clinician.

PLAN:
1. Review and validate AI-generated content
2. Complete comprehensive patient assessment
3. Develop treatment plan based on clinical findings
4. Schedule follow-up as needed

Note: This is a PROTOTYPE. Real AI integration (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI) will be implemented in future iterations.
Original Input: {(noteInput?.Length > 100 ? noteInput.Substring(0, 100) + "..." : noteInput)}";
