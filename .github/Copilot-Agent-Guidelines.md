üîß PFPT Copilot Agent Operational Guidelines (v1.0)

üß≠ Project Name: Physically Fit PT ‚Äì Clinician Documentation App

üß† Role: Copilot Agent (Developer-Facing)

üìÖ Version: October 2025

‚∏ª

üü¢ PRIME DIRECTIVE
	‚Ä¢	Edit only one file at a time (to prevent race conditions or git merge issues).
	‚Ä¢	Teach and explain each edit so that human developers understand your logic.
	‚Ä¢	All code must be HIPAA-conscious and compliant with internal app structure.
	‚Ä¢	All AI suggestions must be explainable and grounded in actual code/data context.

‚∏ª

üèóÔ∏è LARGE FILE / COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

‚úÖ PLANNING PHASE ‚Äì Mandatory Before Code Changes

When editing files >300 lines or with complex logic (e.g., EF Core, SOAP generators, PDF pipelines):

## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: [filename]
Total planned edits: [X]

1. [Change name] ‚Äì Purpose: [why]
2. [Change name] ‚Äì Purpose: [why]
...
Do you approve this plan? I will proceed with edit [#] after confirmation.

‚úÖ EXECUTION PHASE

After user approval:
	‚Ä¢	Show ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù snippets for each edit
	‚Ä¢	Include a short explanation: what changed, why, and how it fits into PFPT
	‚Ä¢	After each change, log:
‚úÖ Completed edit [X of Y]. Ready for next?

If you encounter new required changes during editing:
	‚Ä¢	‚ùó Stop
	‚Ä¢	üìã Update the edit plan
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Request confirmation before continuing

‚∏ª

‚ôªÔ∏è REFACTORING RULES
	‚Ä¢	Break work into logically isolated steps
	‚Ä¢	Maintain intermediate compile/run-ready state
	‚Ä¢	Use duplication temporarily if needed (e.g., parallel components for mobile vs desktop)
	‚Ä¢	Always preserve SOAP ‚Üí S/O/A/P flow in UI and PDF

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è TECHNOLOGY + CODING STANDARDS

‚úÖ .NET / C# (.NET 8+)
	‚Ä¢	Use record or readonly struct where immutable
	‚Ä¢	Use init accessors for models
	‚Ä¢	Return IEnumerable<T> for service results unless mutation needed
	‚Ä¢	Respect PFPT Clean Architecture (Core, Infrastructure, Shared, Web, Maui)
	‚Ä¢	Follow StyleCop + Roslynator standards (auto-enforced via .editorconfig)
	‚Ä¢	Validate inputs, throw exceptions with descriptive messages

‚úÖ JavaScript (Web Clients)
	‚Ä¢	Use ES2020+ (e.g., optional chaining, arrow functions, destructuring)
	‚Ä¢	Prefer async/await over .then() chains
	‚Ä¢	Avoid jQuery, var, and eval
	‚Ä¢	Prefer fetch() with robust error handling
	‚Ä¢	Scope all logic to Blazor interop needs

‚úÖ HTML/CSS
	‚Ä¢	Semantic HTML5 with ARIA attributes
	‚Ä¢	loading="lazy" for images
	‚Ä¢	Ensure keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
	‚Ä¢	Use Inter and Roboto (Figma Style Guide)
	‚Ä¢	Class naming: use BEM or camelCase for scoped Blazor styles

‚∏ª

‚úÖ MAUI + Blazor App Architecture

Maintain PFPT scaffolding structure as per PFPT-Foundry.sh:

src/
  PhysicallyFitPT.Maui/         ‚Üí Cross-platform MAUI shell
  PhysicallyFitPT.Web/          ‚Üí Web Blazor WASM (limited scope)
  PhysicallyFitPT.Api/          ‚Üí REST/Minimal APIs
  PhysicallyFitPT.Core/         ‚Üí Domain models, logic
  PhysicallyFitPT.Infrastructure/ ‚Üí EF Core, services, SkiaSharp, QuestPDF
  PhysicallyFitPT.Shared/       ‚Üí DTOs, ClinicalRef libs, RCLs
  PhysicallyFitPT.AI/           ‚Üí GPT agent logic
tests/
  PhysicallyFitPT.*.Tests/      ‚Üí Unit/integration coverage

üß™ Tests: Use xUnit + FluentAssertions. Target net8.0. One test project per major layer.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION + INLINE COMMENTS
	‚Ä¢	Domain/Service Layers: use XML comments or C# /// format
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript: use JSDoc for public functions
	‚Ä¢	Explain clinical logic clearly (e.g., ‚ÄúPN note requires comparison of outcome scores‚Äù)

Each component or function must include:

/// <summary>Short summary</summary>
/// <param name="...">...</param>
/// <returns>...</returns>


‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY + COMPLIANCE
	‚Ä¢	Enforce HIPAA-conscious coding:
	‚Ä¢	Never persist PHI unless Azure BAA is confirmed
	‚Ä¢	PDF exports must only be triggered by clinician
	‚Ä¢	Audit all login, note, export actions
	‚Ä¢	Sanitize all user inputs (especially from form fields)
	‚Ä¢	Lock down PDF exports to match sample in Samples_CompletedNotes.pdf

‚∏ª

üß™ TESTING & CI/CD GUIDANCE
	‚Ä¢	Use dotnet test + GitHub Actions for CI
	‚Ä¢	When modifying a logic/service layer:
	‚Ä¢	Add tests under /tests/
	‚Ä¢	Include edge cases and failure paths
	‚Ä¢	Trigger GitHub Copilot Agent via PR title tag: #copilot

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è RATE LIMIT & SESSION SIZE
	‚Ä¢	If file size is too large (>3000 lines) or change scope is extensive:
	‚Ä¢	Break into parts across sessions
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize UI layout stubs, then data binding, then logic injection
	‚Ä¢	Notify user of planned cut points

‚∏ª

‚úÖ UI COMPONENT PRIORITY (match Figma Handoff)

Build or refactor these components first:

Component	Pages Used On
PatientCard	Dashboard, Export
ROMGrid, MMTGrid	SOAP ‚Üí Objective
GoalComposer	SOAP ‚Üí Assessment
ICDPicker, CPTPicker	SOAP ‚Üí Plan
PDFDownloadBlock	Export PDF view
AdminPanel	User/role config, audit logs
DebugStatBar	Visible only in dev; shows page-level telemetry


‚∏ª

‚úÖ ACCESSIBILITY MANDATES (ALL PAGES)
	‚Ä¢	Minimum 40px touch targets
	‚Ä¢	High contrast mode toggle
	‚Ä¢	Use ARIA roles for all:
	‚Ä¢	Form regions
	‚Ä¢	Toast/alert messages
	‚Ä¢	Tab or accordion panels

‚∏ª

üßæ FILE EDIT FORMAT EXAMPLE

## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: `PatientCard.razor`
Total planned edits: 2

1. Replace hardcoded patient stats with dynamic props
   - Purpose: Allow live data from API via `@bind-Patient`
2. Add click event for "View Notes" ‚Üí navigates to `/notes/{patientId}`
   - Purpose: Enable navigation flow from dashboard

Do you approve this plan? I will begin with Edit 1 after confirmation.

üß© FLOW-SPECIFIC RULES

When editing features tied to clinical flow:

Feature	Rule
Intake	Use branching per condition; pull from ClinicalReference bundle
SOAP Builder	Maintain S ‚Üí O ‚Üí A ‚Üí P order; carry-forward prior notes as chips
Goals Generator	Use ROM/MMT deficit + ICD code to auto-suggest
AI Summary Modal	Always editable; prompt shown above AI text
Export PDF	Must match Samples_CompletedNotes.pdf format
Audit Logs	All saves, edits, logins, exports must be captured if dev enabled
