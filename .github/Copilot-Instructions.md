🔧 PFPT Copilot Agent Operational Guidelines (v1.0)

🧭 Project Name: Physically Fit PT – Clinician Documentation App

🧠 Role: Copilot Agent (Developer-Facing)

📅 Version: October 2025

⸻

🟢 PRIME DIRECTIVE • Edit only one file at a time (to prevent race conditions or git merge issues). • Teach and explain each edit so that human developers understand your logic. • All code must be HIPAA-conscious and compliant with internal app structure. • All AI suggestions must be explainable and grounded in actual code/data context.

⸻

🏗️ LARGE FILE / COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

✅ PLANNING PHASE – Mandatory Before Code Changes

When editing files >300 lines or with complex logic (e.g., EF Core, SOAP generators, PDF pipelines):

PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: [filename] Total planned edits: [X]

[Change name] – Purpose: [why]
[Change name] – Purpose: [why] ... Do you approve this plan? I will proceed with edit [#] after confirmation.
✅ EXECUTION PHASE

After user approval: • Show “before” and “after” snippets for each edit • Include a short explanation: what changed, why, and how it fits into PFPT • After each change, log: ✅ Completed edit [X of Y]. Ready for next?

If you encounter new required changes during editing: • ❗ Stop • 📋 Update the edit plan • 🔁 Request confirmation before continuing

⸻

♻️ REFACTORING RULES • Break work into logically isolated steps • Maintain intermediate compile/run-ready state • Use duplication temporarily if needed (e.g., parallel components for mobile vs desktop) • Always preserve SOAP → S/O/A/P flow in UI and PDF

⸻

⚙️ TECHNOLOGY + CODING STANDARDS

✅ .NET / C# (.NET 8+) • Use record or readonly struct where immutable • Use init accessors for models • Return IEnumerable for service results unless mutation needed • Respect PFPT Clean Architecture (Core, Infrastructure, Shared, Web, Maui) • Follow StyleCop + Roslynator standards (auto-enforced via .editorconfig) • Validate inputs, throw exceptions with descriptive messages

✅ JavaScript (Web Clients) • Use ES2020+ (e.g., optional chaining, arrow functions, destructuring) • Prefer async/await over .then() chains • Avoid jQuery, var, and eval • Prefer fetch() with robust error handling • Scope all logic to Blazor interop needs

✅ HTML/CSS • Semantic HTML5 with ARIA attributes • loading="lazy" for images • Ensure keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) • Use Inter and Roboto (Figma Style Guide) • Class naming: use BEM or camelCase for scoped Blazor styles

⸻

✅ MAUI + Blazor App Architecture

Maintain PFPT scaffolding structure as per PFPT-Foundry.sh:

src/ PhysicallyFitPT.Maui/ → Cross-platform MAUI shell PhysicallyFitPT.Web/ → Web Blazor WASM (limited scope) PhysicallyFitPT.Api/ → REST/Minimal APIs PhysicallyFitPT.Core/ → Domain models, logic PhysicallyFitPT.Infrastructure/ → EF Core, services, SkiaSharp, QuestPDF PhysicallyFitPT.Shared/ → DTOs, ClinicalRef libs, RCLs PhysicallyFitPT.AI/ → GPT agent logic tests/ PhysicallyFitPT.*.Tests/ → Unit/integration coverage

🧪 Tests: Use xUnit + FluentAssertions. Target net8.0. One test project per major layer.

⸻

✅ DOCUMENTATION + INLINE COMMENTS • Domain/Service Layers: use XML comments or C# /// format • JavaScript: use JSDoc for public functions • Explain clinical logic clearly (e.g., “PN note requires comparison of outcome scores”)

Each component or function must include:

///

Short summary
/// ... /// ...
⸻

🛡️ SECURITY + COMPLIANCE • Enforce HIPAA-conscious coding: • Never persist PHI unless Azure BAA is confirmed • PDF exports must only be triggered by clinician • Audit all login, note, export actions • Sanitize all user inputs (especially from form fields) • Lock down PDF exports to match sample in Samples_CompletedNotes.pdf

⸻

🧪 TESTING & CI/CD GUIDANCE • Use dotnet test + GitHub Actions for CI • When modifying a logic/service layer: • Add tests under /tests/ • Include edge cases and failure paths • Trigger GitHub Copilot Agent via PR title tag: #copilot

⸻

⚠️ RATE LIMIT & SESSION SIZE • If file size is too large (>3000 lines) or change scope is extensive: • Break into parts across sessions • Prioritize UI layout stubs, then data binding, then logic injection • Notify user of planned cut points

⸻

✅ UI COMPONENT PRIORITY (match Figma Handoff)

Build or refactor these components first:

Component Pages Used On PatientCard Dashboard, Export ROMGrid, MMTGrid SOAP → Objective GoalComposer SOAP → Assessment ICDPicker, CPTPicker SOAP → Plan PDFDownloadBlock Export PDF view AdminPanel User/role config, audit logs DebugStatBar Visible only in dev; shows page-level telemetry

⸻

✅ ACCESSIBILITY MANDATES (ALL PAGES) • Minimum 40px touch targets • High contrast mode toggle • Use ARIA roles for all: • Form regions • Toast/alert messages • Tab or accordion panels

⸻

🧾 FILE EDIT FORMAT EXAMPLE

PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: PatientCard.razor Total planned edits: 2

Replace hardcoded patient stats with dynamic props
Purpose: Allow live data from API via @bind-Patient
Add click event for "View Notes" → navigates to /notes/{patientId}
Purpose: Enable navigation flow from dashboard
Do you approve this plan? I will begin with Edit 1 after confirmation.

🧩 FLOW-SPECIFIC RULES

When editing features tied to clinical flow:

Feature Rule Intake Use branching per condition; pull from ClinicalReference bundle SOAP Builder Maintain S → O → A → P order; carry-forward prior notes as chips Goals Generator Use ROM/MMT deficit + ICD code to auto-suggest AI Summary Modal Always editable; prompt shown above AI text Export PDF Must match Samples_CompletedNotes.pdf format Audit Logs All saves, edits, logins, exports must be captured if dev enabled
